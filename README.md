## Setting up AWS on RH
a. Creating an instance
-	Open RH and create a linux instance -> in this case search for Ubuntu 18.04 image from images and click on launch
-	It will prompt you to select spot instance type and other settings, leave them as is
-	Once created the image appears in the top under “Sessions”
-	Right click on the image and click check connectivity info
-	Download the private keys .pem and .ppk and rename them to something memorable and easier
-	Download WinSCP and putty (for windows os)
 
 
b. Setting up WinSCP and putty
- Open WinSCP and log in by entering the host name, port number and ppk downloaded from step 5 above.

-	Once this is done clone the John the Ripper git repo into the home directory i.e. ubuntu/home/code/JohnTheRipper
-	Open Putty.exe (in my case I could not open it directly from my WinSCP for some reason). Connect to putty by entering the port number,   name and keys as follows
